# (Old) Apple Website Clone

## About

This is a clone of an [old (2014) version of the Apple website](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/). The purpose of this was to practice using gradients, as part of [The Odin Project HTML and CSS Module](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients).

### Live Demo

[GitHub Pages](https://kath-ldn.github.io/apple-clone/).

### Built with

HTML & CSS.

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements.

## Roadmap

None planned.

### Known Issues

* As usual, I did as much of this as possible without inspecting the detail of specific elements/styles - so it is not a carbon copy, but reflects how I could do things without copying and pasting.

* The original website is not responsive so neither is this one.

* The gradient in the original is a bit sharper than mine - again because I didn't copy and paste.

* Links etc. are mocked.
