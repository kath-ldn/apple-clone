# Clone of old Apple Website
Original address: https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/
All content may be copyright Apple - this is just for educational purposes.

## To note
- Uses only HTML and CSS - so no JS interactivity.
- I did as much of the page as possible without inspecting the detail of specific elements/styles - so it is not a perfect copy, but reflects how I could do things without copying.

## Known areas to improve
- Original gradient is a bit sharper than mine.
- Not responsive - to add media queries/utilise min & max to make responsive.
- Links are mocked.
- Images (particularly nav) are not as crisp as original site.
